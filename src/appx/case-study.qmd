Report Studied: FiveThirtyEight German Election

What we liked: The formatting.
I like how the article sets up every chart with background to help the reader understand the charts.
The accessibility of the charts.
The visualizations use colors that are easy to understand, as well as adding labels everywhere.

What we didn't like: The bar graphs with the circles.
The graphs are hard to understand with the amount of information present in the visualization.
