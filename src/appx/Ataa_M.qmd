This article largely talked about the importance of creating a positive team culture as the leader of a team. It first says that it is important that the relationships are of "trust and loyalty" rather than "fear." This trust and loyalty should be felt not only between you and the others but between everybody in the group. It is important that communication, delegation, and consensus are present when working in a team. Too, along with this positive inclusive culture, it is important that there are clear goals and objectives that the team is working towards and working to achieve. These things will lead to the most productivity and overall success of the team.
